For seeding purposes, we will be using the Official Global VRS Ranking posted on the 1st of September. 

Additional Information:
• No VRS filter and no VRS invitations. Sign-ups are open to all teams
• Seeding will be based on the official VRS Rankings released by Valve in September
• The event is open to teams from the Global Region, as defined in Valve's official rules & regulations.
• The entire tournament, including both the Qualifying Group Stage and the Double Elimination Playoff, will be played on LAN at Nexus Gamers Pub, Bucharest
• There are no additional compensations for teams or players outside of the prize pool.
• Our event aligns with Valve’s Ranked Tier 2 requirements. While Tier 2 events may use direct VRS invitations, Draculan will not issue direct invites. Instead, the top 4 or top 8 (depending on the number of sign-ups) registered teams by VRS (two weeks prior) will be directly seeded into the Main Event.

Tournament date: 24th of September - 28th of September 2025
